# Block 20A: Writing JavaScript Tests

Guided in-class project for Block 20A: Writing JavaScript Tests.

In this project we will learn about writing Jest and DOM tests

## Objectives

- Compose simple unit tests for a hypothetical function/application.
- Write the function/application to satisfy the tests.
- Develop tests for frontend DOM using Jest and jest-dom
- Describe the use and purpose of mocking and stubbing in automated tests

## Instructions to run this project

- Using your command line, navigate into the project folder
- Run `npm i` in your command line to install the necessary files
- Use the Live Server extension to run the html file
- Run `npm test` in your command line to run the tests
  - To run an individual test run `npm test filename` ex `npm test dom.test.js` will run a file called `dom.test.js`

## Steps to complete the project

### Jest

Search for "ðŸ‘‰ STEP " within the `__tests__/reverseString.test.js` file to find where each step is located.
